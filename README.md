# üìä AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard

An advanced, production-ready analytics dashboard built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **shadcn/ui**, leveraging **AI assistance** via **v0 by Vercel** to generate reusable UI components, complex chart animations, and real-time data simulation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time updating table with smooth row animations
- Fully responsive layout with mobile-first design
- Advanced filtering and KPI trend indicators
- Cinema-quality push-down animations for table rows
- Glassmorphism UI and custom SVG chart animations
- Global state management and error boundary patterns
- TypeScript strict mode with 100% interface coverage
- Accessibility-first approach with ARIA support

## ü§ñ AI Tools & Use Cases

### AI Assistant: `v0 by Vercel`

Used extensively for:

- Full React component scaffolding
- Complex SVG chart logic and CSS animations
- Loading states, error boundaries, and layout patterns
- Mock data simulation for dynamic UI testing
- UI/UX component composition using shadcn/ui

## üìå Sample Prompts Used

> Here are some of the prompts used to co-develop this dashboard:

1. **"Create a responsive analytics dashboard with real-time updates, advanced filtering, export functionality, and cinema-quality animations..."**
   - Result: Generated full UI layout with animated table components and live simulation logic.

2. **"Fix the table animation glitch ‚Äì I want existing rows to smoothly push down when a new row is added..."**
   - Result: CSS keyframes and React state were fine-tuned to sequence animations precisely.

3. **"Add enterprise-grade error boundaries, smart chart wrapper components, sparklines for KPI cards..."**
   - Result: Introduced reusable error components, interactive deltas, and chart wrappers.
